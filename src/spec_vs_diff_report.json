  "summary": "REQ-2 (frontend startup recovery with auto retry/backoff and retry re-init) appears implemented via new startup gate logic and safe actor initialization with retries/timeouts. REQ-1 (backend healthCheck reliability / clean rebuild) is partially evidenced by a healthCheck() returning true, but the diff does not provide enough evidence about clean redeploy/state reset behavior. Several UI/theme and navigation changes appear unrelated to the request and include a Settings page theme change that conflicts with stated non-goals.",
